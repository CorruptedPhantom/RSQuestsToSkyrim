My Arm’s Big Adventure

Death Plateau - A group of Imperials (or Stormcloaks after Battle of Hjaalmarch) are having issues clearing the entrance of Labyrinthian. Assist them if you wish.

Troll Stronghold - You receive a note from the faction in control of Labyrinthian that they have received regular coordinated attacks from trolls. Assist them.

Eadgar’s Ruse - Eadgar, a madman, is responsible for the attacks on Labyrinthian. Confront him.

Troll Romance - Having dealt with Eadgar, see to his request that his favorite troll woo her lover.

Making Friends with my Arm - Having helped the affectionately-named My Arm, you should ensure that he befriends you otherwise you might be eaten.

My Arm’s Big Adventure - My Arm loves traveling with you. In fact, he loves it so much that he wants to see all the capitals in Skyrim.
