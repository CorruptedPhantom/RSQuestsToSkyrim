Ernest the Chicken - Ernest is turned into a chicken by Dravynea the Stoneweaver for being too creepy. Help him turn back to human before heâ€™s turned to dinner!
(This quest will automatically fail if Dravynea is dead, and is designed to replace the gathering of Frost Salts quest as a prerequisite for marriage)
