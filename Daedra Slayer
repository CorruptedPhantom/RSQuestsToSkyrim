Daedra Slayer -> The Golem -> Shadow of the Storm

Daedra Slayer - You are approached by a member of the Vigilants of Stendarr (or Dawnguard after the attack on the Hall) and are asked to destroy the daedra Delrith outside Winterhold.

The Golem - You are contacted by note to help destroy another daedra in Markarthâ€™s Nchuand-Zel. You arrive to find the sender, a passive Dwarven Centurion, in disrepair, falsely believing there to be a daedra. You are to repair him.

Shadow of the Storm - The Centurion was not entirely broken, you find out, as you return to see the fearsome Agrith-Naar causing an attack in Understone Keep. You are to stop him.
